# Agricola Scorepad

![Scorepad](http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic391243_lg.jpg)

Used as an intro to Ember/Ember-data 1.0.

## Usage

_Doesn't actually work on your machine... I forked ember-rails locally to update ember versions. 
Some weird Rails 4 asset thing_

Start up the `rails server` and visit the home page. Add players, then click on the scores to edit their values. Scores will update.

## Todo

Needs some serious CSS
